        Security-aware systems require sophisticated System-on-Chip (SoC) technology involving high performance embedded microprocessors and reconfigurable hardware such as Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed CALAS studies and invents new approaches to design and to implement security-aware systems with the consideration of time-area, performance-security, and energy-cost tradeoffs. The proposed research includes security-aware hardware such as microprocessors with security-related custom-instructions, robust datapath designs, multi-core security, and secure embedded systems.

        ## Research Interests
        Our research at CALAS (Computer Architecture Lab for Arithmetic and Security) focuses on:
        - High-Performance & Customisable Biomedical and Bioinformatics Computing
        - AIoT Designs 
        - Reconfigurable Trusted Computing
        - VLSI/FPGA Circuit Designs
        - Cryptography
        - System-on-Chip Architecture
        - Embedded System Designs

        ## **Hot! Postdoc / PhD / RA Position Opening**
        We are actively recruiting outstanding international PhD/MPhil candidates, Postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scholars to join our team in Hong Kong. Successful candidates will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects in security-aware systems and reconfigurable computing. 
        
        ## Teaching Activities
        In addition to research, the CALAS group is enthusiastic about teaching. Since 2021, the CALAS group, under the CityUHK EE department, has been hosting a Gifted Education Off-School Advanced Learning Programme funded by the Gifted Education Fund from Education Bureau each year.

        The OSALP provides secondary students with weekly lessons related to the programme topic. The programme is updated each year. You can find out more about this yearâ€™s programme on the our [cityueegef website](https://cityueegef.github.io/about/).
