Good job Ashraf! Two US patents have been filed in a row!

<div style="text-align: justify">

Congratulations to Ashraf on this outstanding achievement! We are delighted to announce that the US patent "Scalable and Robust Tubal CUR Decomposition for Large-scale Multidimensional Tensors" has been filed for approval.

What's more exciting is that another patent is already in the loop: "IncTSVD: Incremental Tensor Singular Value Decomposition of Multidimensional Streaming Data". That's two patents in a row!

For team members who would like to pursue a career in industry, filing a patent is an essential experience for you. This is a great example of how research work at CALAS can translate into intellectual property that has real-world impact.

Congratulations once again to Ashraf on this remarkable accomplishment!
