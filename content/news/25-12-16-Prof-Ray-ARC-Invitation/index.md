ARC is a prestigious international symposium that brings together researchers and practitioners in reconfigurable computing, with proceedings published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The conference will be held in Cagliari, Italy, from April 8-10, 2026. Now in its 22nd edition, the symposium has established itself as a leading venue for advancing research in FPGA architectures, hardware acceleration, cryptographic implementations, and emerging applications in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

This invitation recognizes Prof. Ray's expertise and sustained contributions to the reconfigurable computing community. As a Program Committee member, he will play a vital role in reviewing submissions and shaping the technical program for ARC 2026. The symposium's research themes align closely with CALAS's core focus areas, including hardware security, cryptographic acceleration, and FPGA-based system design.

We are honored to see Prof. Ray's leadership and scholarly impact acknowledged by the international research community. Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition!
