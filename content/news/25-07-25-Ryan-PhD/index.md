<div style="text-align: justify">
Ryan has been a dedicated member of the CALAS team for over three years, during which Prof. Ray supported his pursuit of a part-time Master's degree alongside his RA responsibilities. This unique combination enriched both his academic and research experience, creating a perfect foundation for his doctoral journey.
During his time as an RA, Ryan worked on low-complexity Number Theoretic Transforms (NTT) design for DSP applications - a project that sparked his passion for low-complexity arithmetic unit design and ultimately inspired his decision to pursue a PhD. His hands-on research experience, combined with his BEng from HKUST (2021) and MSc in Electrical Engineering from CityU, demonstrates his commitment to advancing the field.
We're excited to see Ryan continue this academic journey and contribute to cutting-edge research in electrical engineering. Wishing you all the best in this new chapter, Ryan!
