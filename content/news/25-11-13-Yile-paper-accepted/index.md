This success was made possible through Donald's valuable support and collaboration throughout the research process.

IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing stands as one of the field's most prestigious venues, boasting an impressive impact factor of 5.8 and a distinguished history dating back to 1953. Published by the IEEE Signal Processing Society, this classical journal represents a premier platform for cutting-edge signal processing research.

Yile's perseverance is particularly commendable—after submitting in November last year, the paper underwent a rigorous one-year review process before acceptance. Her dedication exemplifies the patience and commitment required for publishing at top-tier venues.

This achievement opens new opportunities for CALAS members, as Prof. Ray encourages our team to explore TIP for future submissions. The journal's scope aligns well with our research strengths in computational acceleration and algorithmic optimization.

Congratulations, Yile! Well done to the entire team!
