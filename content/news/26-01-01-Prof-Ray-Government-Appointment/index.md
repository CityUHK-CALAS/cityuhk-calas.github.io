Excellence has been recognized as Prof. Ray Cheung Chak-chung has been appointed by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR Government as a member of the Appeal Panel under the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Ordinance (Cap. 653)!

This prestigious two-year appointment, effective from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027, reflects Prof. Cheung's distinguished expertise in computer systems security and his significant contributions to Hong Kong's technology landscape. The Appeal Panel, established under Section 47 of the Ordinance, serves as an independent mechanism for Critical Infrastructure Operators who disagree with designations or written directions issued by the Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure (Computer-system Security) or designated authorities. An appeal board, formed by members drawn from the panel, has the authority to affirm, reverse, or vary decisions under review.

The Ordinance, Hong Kong's first comprehensive cybersecurity legislation, came into effect on January 1, 2026, establishing a robust legal framework to safeguard computer systems of critical infrastructures, regulate their operators, and investigate and respond to computer-system security threats and incidents.

This government appointment underscores CALAS's unwavering commitment to advancing cybersecurity research and practice. Congratulations, Prof. Ray!
