Their paper "Interpretable Machine Learning-Based Real-time Sepsis Diagnosis" has been accepted for publication in Nature Scientific Reports, one of the world's most prestigious open-access journals.

Nature Scientific Reports stands as the 3rd most-cited journal globally with over 834,000 citations in 2024 and maintains an impressive Impact Factor of 3.9 (2024). As part of the renowned Nature Portfolio, this Q1 quartile journal publishes rigorous research across the natural sciences, medicine, and engineering, making acceptance a significant accomplishment.

Their work on developing interpretable machine learning systems for real-time sepsis diagnosis represents a critical contribution to advancing healthcare applications of AI. Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units worldwide, and developing interpretable, real-time diagnostic tools has the potential to save countless lives by enabling faster clinical decision-making.

Congratulations to Prof. Mehdi and his student on this well-deserved recognition! We look forward to seeing the impact of their research in the medical AI community.
