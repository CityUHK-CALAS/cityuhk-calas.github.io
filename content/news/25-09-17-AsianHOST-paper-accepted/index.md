<div style="text-align: justify">
We are thrilled to announce that our research excellence continues to gain international recognition! Our paper titled "An Efficient Barrett Modular Multiplier Design for Zero-Knowledge Proof" has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE Asian Hardware Oriented Security and Trust Symposium (AsianHOST) 2025.<br>

This outstanding achievement reflects the collaborative efforts of our talented team members Jiahao Li, Dr. Qiang Liu, Prof. Ray C.C. Cheung, and Dr. Zhaohui Guo. Their innovative work addresses critical challenges in zero-knowledge proof implementations through efficient Barrett modular multiplication architectures.

AsianHOST stands as the premier IEEE-sponsored symposium dedicated to facilitating hardware-based security research and development across the Asia-Pacific region. The symposium serves as a vital platform for presenting cutting-edge developments in hardware security, cryptographic implementations, and trusted computing systems. Our acceptance at this highly selective venue underscores CALAS's commitment to advancing the frontiers of secure hardware design.

The proposed Barrett modular multiplier design represents significant progress in cryptographic hardware acceleration, particularly for emerging post-quantum and privacy-preserving applications. This research directly aligns with CALAS's mission to develop innovative arithmetic and security solutions for next-generation computing systems.

We extend our congratulations to all team members and look forward to presenting this groundbreaking work at AsianHOST 2025!
