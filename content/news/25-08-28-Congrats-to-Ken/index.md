Congratulations are in order for Mr. Ken C.H. Ching on the acceptance of his groundbreaking research paper titled "A Novel AIoT-based and User Behaviour-driven Dockless Bike-sharing Management System for Chaotic Operations in a Condensed City" in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (Impact Factor: 8.4). This significant milestone comes after two rounds of revisions, demonstrating Ken's dedication and perseverance in advancing cutting-edge research.

Ken brings a unique entrepreneurial perspective to his Ph.D. studies in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at CityU. As the 4th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Outstanding Young Entrepreneur and founder of LocoBike—one of Hong Kong's most popular bike-sharing brands—he has successfully bridged the gap between academic research and real-world applications. His work integrates AIoT and machine learning technologies to enhance urban micro-mobility solutions, perfectly aligning with his practical experience in promoting eco-friendly transportation.

With his strong academic foundation (B.Eng. and M.Sc. from HKUST) and extensive entrepreneurial background spanning transportation, e-commerce, and F&B industries, Ken continues to exemplify the innovative spirit that drives CALAS forward.

Keep up the great work, Ken! This is just the beginning of what promises to be an impactful research journey.
