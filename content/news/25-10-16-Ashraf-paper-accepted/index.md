Ashraf's paper, "SR-TCUR: Scalable and Robust Tubal CUR Decomposition for Large-Scale Multidimensional Tensors," addresses critical challenges in tensor decomposition for large-scale data analysis. This work demonstrates innovative approaches to handling multidimensional data structures, with significant implications for machine learning and computational efficiency.

The acceptance in Neurocomputing reflects the high quality and impact of Ashraf's research contributions. As Prof. Ray noted, tensor analysis may initially seem challenging, but with passion, hard work, and dedication, remarkable outcomes can be achieved. This publication exemplifies the collaborative spirit at CALAS, where team members learn from each other and grow together.

Congratulations, Ashraf, on this well-deserved recognition! Your dedication to advancing tensor decomposition methods continues to strengthen CALAS's reputation in computational research.
