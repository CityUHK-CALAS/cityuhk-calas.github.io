This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy given the conference's highly competitive selection process, with only 4,167 papers accepted from 23,680 submissions—an impressive 17.6% acceptance rate.

Camilla's success reflects not only her dedication and hard work but also the exceptional mentorship provided by Prof. Jenny, whose guidance was instrumental throughout this research journey. Prof. Ray's unwavering support of our team members' pursuit of excellence at flagship conferences continues to inspire us all.

AAAI (the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) represents one of the premier venues in AI research, making this acceptance a significant milestone. We encourage all CALAS members to follow Camilla's example by targeting top-tier conferences, where the rigorous review process offers invaluable learning experiences and opportunities for growth.

Congratulations, Camilla—we couldn't be prouder!
