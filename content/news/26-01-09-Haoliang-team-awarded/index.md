Let's applaud Professor Li Haoliang and his student Wu Chengkai (吴程凯) for their exceptional achievement! The team from City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan) has secured second prize in the prestigious RISC-V + OpenHarmony AI Application Development track at the Third OpenAtom Competition.

The Third OpenAtom Competition, officially launched at the 2025 OpenAtom Open Source Ecosystem Conference in July, stands as China's premier national-level open source technology competition. Organized by the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation, the competition attracts participants from leading universities and enterprises nationwide, with a total prize pool of 15 million RMB. This track focuses on innovative AI application development combining RISC-V architecture chips with the open-source OpenHarmony operating system—a cutting-edge technical challenge perfectly aligned with our lab's expertise in RISC-V systems and hardware-software co-design.

This achievement reflects the exceptional technical capabilities and innovative spirit of our CityU Dongguan team. Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition!
