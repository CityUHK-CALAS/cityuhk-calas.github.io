Her work, titled "Towards Faster Key Switching in FHE: A Unified GPU Implementation for KLSS," tackles one of the most critical performance bottlenecks in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) systems. This innovative research presents a unified GPU implementation that significantly accelerates key switching operations, a fundamental component that enables encrypted data to be processed without decryption. By optimizing the KLSS (Key-Switching for Leveled/SIMD) scheme on GPU architectures, Claire's work contributes to making FHE more practical for real-world privacy-preserving applications.

The acceptance at Mathematics underscores the significance and quality of Claire's contribution to the cryptography and secure computation community. This achievement exemplifies the cutting-edge research excellence fostered at CALAS and demonstrates our team's commitment to advancing privacy-preserving technologies.

Congratulations to Claire on this well-deserved recognition!
