Prof. Ray has been listed in version 7 of the Stanford's list of top 2% most cited scientists in the world (single recent year) released on 16/9/2024.

The Stanford's list of top 2% most cited scientists in the world identifies scholars who have published multiple highly cited papers ranked according to various metrics on citation impact across multiple scientific fields and subfields based on Scopus data for career-long, and, separately, for single recent year impact. The selection is based on the top 100,000 scientists by c-score (with and without self-citations) or a percentile rank of 2% or above in the sub-field.
