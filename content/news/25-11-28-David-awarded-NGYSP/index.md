This is a tremendous milestone and recognition of David's outstanding research excellence. Prof. Hu, who earned his PhD from CALAS and is currently a postdoc fellow at NTU Singapore, has now been selected for this highly competitive national talent program and will be joining [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn) (北京理工大學), one of China's top-tier universities. BIT is a Double First-Class Category A university (雙一流A類), and was part of both the original 985 Project and 211 Project, representing the highest tier of Chinese universities.

The National Global Young Scientists Program (海外优青) is one of China's most prestigious talent programs, designed to attract exceptional young researchers from around the world to contribute to China's scientific and technological advancement. This achievement reflects David's remarkable research capabilities and his potential to make significant contributions to his field.

Prof. Hu joins an impressive legacy of CALAS graduates who have gone on to become professors and leading researchers around the world. We are proud to share that CALAS has now produced over 10 graduates who hold professorial positions at universities globally, demonstrating the world-class training and research environment fostered at our lab.

David's journey from PhD student at CALAS to postdoc at NTU Singapore, and now to professor at a top Chinese university through this prestigious program, exemplifies the career trajectories our graduates achieve. His success serves as an inspiration to current and future CALAS members, showcasing the impact of dedication, excellence, and the strong foundation built during their time in our research group.

We are incredibly proud of this achievement, David, and we look forward to seeing your continued contributions to advancing research excellence at Beijing Institute of Technology!
