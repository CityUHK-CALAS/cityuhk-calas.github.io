This publication represents a significant milestone, as IEEE TNNLS is a highly respected Q1 journal with an impact factor of 10.2. Ashraf's work addresses the challenging problem of efficiently processing multidimensional streaming data through incremental tensor decomposition methods, contributing valuable insights to the machine learning and neural networks community.
As Prof. Ray noted, mastering this research process creates opportunities to replicate success across multiple dimensions. This achievement reflects Ashraf's dedication to advancing computational methods for real-time data processing. We look forward to seeing how this foundational work will inspire future developments in the field.
