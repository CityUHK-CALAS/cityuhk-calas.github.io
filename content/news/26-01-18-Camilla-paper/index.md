<div style="text-align: justify">

A new chapter begins as we celebrate Camilla's outstanding achievement! We're delighted to announce that Camilla's paper "SGA-GNN: Semantic-Guided Adaptive Graph Neural Network for Cold-Start Multimodal Recommendation" has been accepted for presentation at the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026), taking place May 4-8 in Barcelona, Spain. This year's conference received an impressive 11,120 submissions, making this acceptance a significant accomplishment.

ICASSP stands as the world's largest and most comprehensive technical conference focused on signal processing and its applications, and holds the highest h-index of any conference in the signal processing field. Camilla's work on addressing the cold-start problem in multimodal recommendation systems through semantic-guided adaptive graph neural networks represents an important contribution to advancing intelligent systems research.

This achievement reflects the fruitful collaboration between CALAS and Prof. Jenny, whose mentorship and support were instrumental to this work's success. Camilla expresses her gratitude: "Thank you so much, Prof. Ray and the CALAS team. I'm incredibly grateful for all the guidance and support. Special thanks to Prof. Jenny as well for her mentorship on this paper. Looking forward to more great collaborations in the future!"

Prof. Jenny adds: "Thanks so much for all your great support from Prof. Ray and CALAS members! Camilla is very excellent and works very hard. I am very happy to work with Camilla! We are also looking forward to more collaboration with our CALAS members interested in AI infrastructure, focusing on system design and hardware-software co-design (GPUs, FPGAs, PIM, CXL, RISC-V) for AI applications, such as LLM training, Fine-Tuning, and Inference. We aim to publish our work in top-tier conferences and journals in the HPC and AI areas. Looking forward to more members working together with us!"

Congratulations once again to Camilla, and we look forward to her presentation in Barcelona!
