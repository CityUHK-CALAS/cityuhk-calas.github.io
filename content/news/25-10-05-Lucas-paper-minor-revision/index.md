We're celebrating Dr. Lucas's outstanding achievement as his paper, "HTCNN: High-Throughput Batch CNN Inference with Homomorphic Encryption for Edge Computing," has received minor revision from Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC)!

This milestone is particularly significant given TDSC's reputation as the premier journal in computer security research, widely recognized as the top venue in the field. Dr. Lucas's work addresses critical challenges at the intersection of privacy-preserving computation, artificial intelligence, and edge computingâ€”tackling highly impactful topics that resonate with current industry and research needs.

The paper's innovative approach to enabling secure CNN inference through homomorphic encryption techniques while maintaining high throughput demonstrates the cutting-edge research excellence we pursue at CALAS. This achievement reflects Dr. Lucas's dedication to advancing practical solutions for secure edge computing applications.
Congratulations on this remarkable progress toward publication in such a prestigious venue!
