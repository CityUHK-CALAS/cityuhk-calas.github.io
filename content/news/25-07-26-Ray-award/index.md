This prestigious government recognition highlights his exceptional expertise in innovative education and technology integration.

Prof. Cheung, Associate Provost (Digital Learning) at City University of Hong Kong and Professor in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments, played a crucial role in selecting teachers who demonstrate professional excellence, innovative spirit, and effective use of technology to enhance teaching outcomes. The award ceremony, held on July 4th with Chief Executive John Lee as guest of honor, recognized teachers across primary, secondary, kindergarten, and special schools.

Prof. Cheung expressed his honor in witnessing how teachers "not only impart knowledge but actively use innovative thinking and research technology to inspire students' creativity and exploratory spirit."
