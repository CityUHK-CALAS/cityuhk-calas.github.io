Our paper  “An Application Specific Instruction Set Processor (ASIP) for Adaptive Filters in Neural Prosthetics”  has been accepted for publication in the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB).  In this research work, we explore an application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) for adaptive filters in neural decoding activity.
