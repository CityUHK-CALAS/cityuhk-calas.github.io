We're celebrating an outstanding achievement as Alex and Jeff's research paper has been accepted for publication in Electronics! Their work, titled "FPGA-Based Hybrid Post-Quantum and Classical Cryptography Platform for End-to-End IoT Security," represents a significant contribution to advancing security in IoT systems.

This accomplishment reflects exceptional team collaboration as part of our ITF project. We extend our congratulations to the entire research team—Gary, Gavin, Shiyu, Hao, and Simon—whose dedicated efforts were instrumental in bringing this work to fruition. Special recognition goes to Patrick for providing invaluable guidance throughout the research process.

The paper addresses critical security challenges by combining post-quantum cryptographic techniques with classical approaches, implementing them on FPGA platforms to enable robust, end-to-end protection for IoT devices. This hybrid methodology positions our research at the forefront of preparing IoT infrastructure for future cryptographic threats.

Congratulations to everyone involved in this remarkable achievement!
