We're thrilled to celebrate Yile and the research team's major achievement—their paper "High-Radix/Mixed-Radix NTT Multiplication Algorithm/Architecture Co-design over Fermat Modulus" has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC) after two rounds of revision!

<div style="text-align: justify">
This is a significant milestone, as IEEE TC is a top-tier journal in computer science with an impressive 3.6 impact factor and Q1 ranking across multiple categories including computer architecture and theoretical computer science. The journal covers cutting-edge research in computer organizations, architectures, and system design—making this acceptance particularly meaningful for work on NTT multiplication algorithms and hardware-software co-design.<br>
Huge congratulations to the entire collaborative team: Yile, Prof. Ray for his expert guidance, Dr. Gavin, Dr. Lucas, Ryan, Prof. Donald, and special thanks to Dr. Shiyu for her insightful feedback during the revision process. This success truly exemplifies the power of teamwork and Prof. Ray's vision for building strong learning clusters as our research group grows.<br>
Well done, everyone!
