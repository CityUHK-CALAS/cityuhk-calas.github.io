We are thrilled to congratulate Simon, Henry, and Mark on the acceptance of their research paper titled "SwiftChannel: Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design for Deep Learning-Based 5G Channel Estimation" at IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing!

This outstanding achievement comes after two rigorous rounds of revision, demonstrating the team's dedication and perseverance. IEEE TMC stands as one of the premier venues in mobile computing research, boasting an impressive Impact Factor of 9.2.

Special thanks to Prof. Ray Cheung for his invaluable guidance and support throughout the publication journey, and to all co-authors and CALAS members who contributed to this success.

In the spirit of open science, the team has open-sourced all 5G simulation, deep-learning, and FPGA HLS code for the research community. We welcome discussions and collaborations!
