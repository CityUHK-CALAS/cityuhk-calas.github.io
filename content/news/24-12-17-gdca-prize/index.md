We are proud to celebrate the success of Donald’s team at UIC and Winston, distinguished graduates of CALAS. Their team has been honored with the prestigious GDCA Outstanding Paper Award (First Prize)  for their remarkable project: *“Yet Another Improvement of Plantard Arithmetic for Faster Kyber on Low-end 32-bit IoT Devices”*.
This achievement is a testament to the continuous growth and excellence of CALAS alumni, showcasing their impactful contributions across the Greater Bay Area and beyond.
Congratulations once again to Donald, Joshua, Prof. Chen, and the entire team on this well-deserved recognition. The CALAS legacy continues to flourish and inspire!
