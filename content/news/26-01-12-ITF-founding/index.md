Breaking news from CALAS: our research proposal "Advanced Transform Frameworks on Secure RISC-V for Smart City Infrastructure" has been successfully funded with HK$1.33 million from the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF)!

The ITF, administered by Hong Kong's Innovation and Technology Commission, supports cutting-edge research projects that enhance technological competitiveness and drive innovation. This funding recognizes CALAS's leadership in RISC-V architecture and hardware security—two critical pillars for building secure and efficient smart city infrastructure.

Following our oral interview presentation in July 2025 and a rigorous six-month evaluation process, we're thrilled to move forward with this ambitious project. Special recognition goes to Patrick for his excellent presentation during the interview, along with Jeff, Sanka, and all team members whose dedicated efforts made this proposal successful.

This achievement reflects our lab's commitment to addressing real-world challenges through innovative research. As we embark on this exciting project, we look forward to developing transformative solutions for secure smart city deployments!
