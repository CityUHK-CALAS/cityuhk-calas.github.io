Congratulations are in order for Harry, whose paper "RO-SVD+: A Hardware-Based Framework Against AI Attacks for Cost-Effective GenAI Copyright Protection in Consumer Electronics" has been accepted at IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (Impact Factor: 10.9)!

This work addresses critical challenges in AI security, integrating Transformers, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) to develop cost-effective copyright protection solutions for generative AI in consumer electronics.

We extend our gratitude to Prof. Ray Cheung for his guidance and mentorship. Special thanks go to Lucas and Meng for their dedicated contributions, and to Ashraf and JerryZ for their invaluable theoretical insights and framework development during the earlier ASAP project.
This collaborative achievement exemplifies the CALAS spirit of teamwork and innovation in hardware security research.

For more details, stay tuned for updates on potential open-source releases of the PUF implementation.
