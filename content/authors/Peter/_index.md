I am an undergraduate student (2024 - 2028) at the University of Toronto pursuing a Computer Science Specialist degree. Skilled in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and SQL, I am passionate about collaborative innovation and efficient communication.
As an intern at CALAS-CityUHK, I explore digital design, instruction set architecture, Verilog, and C-based HLS. My goal is to integrate software and hardware seamlessly by developing a robust RISC-V softcore and a basic operating system on it from scratches.
