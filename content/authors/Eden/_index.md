Eden ZHAO graduated from the Department of Electronic Engineering at City University of Hong Kong in 2024 with an MSc in Electronic Information Engineering. Since 2021, he has worked as an Embedded Development Engineer and Project Development Representative at a research institution in mainland China, focusing on radar system development. During his graduate studies, he explored AI technologies and interned at Sengital Limited, where he participated in AIoT and edge computing projects. In 2025, he officially joined Sengital Limited and began his Ph.D. studies at City University of Hong Kong. Eden ZHAO is currently involved in two AIoT-related projects. Smart Farm integrates precision agriculture with edge computing to enable large-scale local networking and closed-loop control, reducing dependence on high-quality network environments and lowering bandwidth requirements. Its core functions include crop classification, growth status analysis, disease and pest detection, intelligent planting strategy decision-making, and expert report generation, providing an efficient and intelligent solution for agricultural production. Meanwhile, Smart Baseball utilizes sensors and smartphones to precisely calculate the trajectory of a baseball, including speed, spin rate, landing point, motion trajectory modeling, and posture analysis. The project aims to provide athletes with accurate and cost-effective training guidance, optimizing training effectiveness and enhancing athletic performance.
