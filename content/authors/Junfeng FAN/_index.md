Dr. Junfeng Fan is an internationally renowned expert in cryptography and hardware security, recognized for his pioneering contributions to fully homomorphic encryption and secure chip design. He received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Zhejiang University, China in 2003, followed by his Master's degree in 2006. He completed his PhD in Embedded Security at KU Leuven in 2010 under the supervision of Prof. Ingrid Verbauwhede, a leading authority in hardware security and cryptographic engineering. His doctoral research focused on efficient implementations of cryptographic algorithms and side-channel attack countermeasures.

Dr. Fan is internationally recognized as the co-inventor of the BFV (Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren) fully homomorphic encryption scheme, one of the most widely adopted FHE algorithms in both academic research and practical applications. This seminal work has become foundational to privacy-preserving computation technologies worldwide. His scholarly contributions include over 30 publications in premier international venues such as CHES (Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems), IEEE Transactions on Computers, and other top-tier conferences and journals. His research expertise encompasses cryptographic algorithm design, particularly fully homomorphic encryption and post-quantum cryptography, secure chip architecture and implementation, advanced side-channel attack methodologies and defense mechanisms, and efficient hardware and software implementations of security primitives. Dr. Fan served as Program Chair of CHES 2021, one of the most prestigious international conferences in cryptographic hardware and embedded systems security, reflecting his leadership position in the global cryptography research community.

In 2014, Dr. Fan founded Open Security Research, Inc. (纽创信安; OSR), where he serves as Chief Executive Officer. The company specializes in cryptographic IP cores, security evaluation equipment, and commercial cryptography applications for critical infrastructure. Under his leadership, OSR received the Shenzhen "Peacock Plan" (孔雀计划) entrepreneurship grant in 2015 and was recognized as a "Leading Team" (领航团队) by Shenzhen Nanshan District in 2017. The company's mission centers on "protecting the Internet of Everything," developing advanced technologies, products, and services to safeguard users' lives, property, and privacy in an increasingly connected world. OSR collaborates with distinguished cryptography experts, including Academician Wang Xiaoyun, a globally renowned cryptographer, IACR Fellow, and President of the Chinese Association for Cryptologic Research, who is celebrated for her groundbreaking cryptanalysis of the MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.
