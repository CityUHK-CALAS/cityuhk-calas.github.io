Prof. Ray Chak-Chung Cheung received the B.Eng.(Hons) and M.Phil. degrees in computer engineering and computer science & engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1999 and 2001 respectively, and the DIC and Ph.D. degree in computing from Imperial College London (IC) in 2007.

He joined the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2002 as an Instructor. Before that, he worked as a system administrator in a parallel cluster computing company, Cluster Technology Limited for one year. Two years later in 2004, he received the Hong Kong Croucher Foundation Scholarship and moved to London where he spent three years for his Ph.D. study. He was with Stanford University and UCLA in the summer of 2005 and 2006 as a visiting scholar. After completing his Ph.D. study, he received the Hong Kong Croucher Foundation Fellowship and moved to Los Angeles, in the Electrical Engineering department at UCLA, where he spent two years for continuing his research work. In 2008, he took a 6-month internship at a top IC design company in Hong Kong, Solomon-Systech Limited as a senior digital IC designer. In 2009, he visited the PALMS group in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University as a visiting research fellow before returning to Hong Kong.

He is currently the Associate Provost (Digital Learning) at CityUHK, a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Computer Science, at City University of Hong Kong, and with CityU-EE Xilinx Lab. His current research interests include cryptographic hardware designs and design exploration of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, AIoT designs, and embedded system designs.

He is the current Section Chairman of IEEE HK Section, the former chairman of the IEEE Hong Kong Section CAS/COM Chapter, and executive committee member of the IEEE Hong Kong Section Computer Chapter. He is the author of over 250 journal papers and conference papers, and 8 International patents. He is the advisor for 16 PhD graduates from CityU Architecture Lab for Arithmetic and Security (CALAS), and currently supervises 18 PhD students. He is also the supervisor of the CityU Underwater Robotics Team.
