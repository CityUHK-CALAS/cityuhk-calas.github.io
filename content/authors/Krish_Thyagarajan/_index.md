Krish is studying an Integrated Master’s in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, where he is a Dean’s List awardee. He has worked on projects such as developing an envelope detector for demodulating AM ultrasonic signals and also designing a hardware multiplier for a Harvard Architecture CPU.

As part of the CityU Underwater Robotics team, he has independently developed a VR control system for the lab’s mini submarine. Eager to create solutions that solve real-world problems, he is actively exploring fields like deep learning, robotics and green energy. Beyond his studies, he has actively engaged with the wider tech community through events such as London Tech Week, IET Talks, and the Semi-Impact Forum. He is also participating in Hackathons to gain experience and learn from excellent people.
