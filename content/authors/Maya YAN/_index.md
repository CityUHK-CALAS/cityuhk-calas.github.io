Ms. Tung YAN (Maya) is an undergraduate at the City University of Hong Kong, majoring in Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Forensic Studies. Her academic journey has provided a strong foundation in software, which is complemented by a keen interest in forensics that shapes her perspective on security. She is now eager to bridge these domains by exploring their direct intersection, seeking a deeper understanding of how hardware architecture underpins the entire security landscape of modern computing.
