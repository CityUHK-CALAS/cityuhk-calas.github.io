I am Jiaxing Ju, an undergraduate student majoring in Microelectronic Science and Engineering at the South China University of Technology. With a solid academic foundation, I maintain an excellent academic record, achieving an average score of 80.24/100. I am particularly skilled in embedded systems development, C language programming, analog integrated circuit design (Cadence), and IoT technology applications

I have substantial hands-on project experience, having led a team as the core responsible person to complete a "Full-Stack IoT System" project, during which I successfully developed a 4G remote control subsystem based on ESP32

In terms of awards, I have been honored with the First Prize in the University-Level Engineering Practice, and recognized as an Outstanding Student Cadre and Advanced Class Collective

Additionally, serving as the Class Monitor has honed my exceptional organizational coordination and team management abilities. I actively participate in social practice projects and have received provincial-level honors for an Advanced Team.

My research interests focus on hardware security for IoT devices and the design of high-performance embedded systems. I aspire to pursue further studies in this field, aiming to integrate theoretical innovation with engineering practice.
