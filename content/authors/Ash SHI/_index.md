Ash J. S. Shi received his B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2023. He also holds an M.Sc. in Multimedia Information Technology from City University of Hong Kong, where he is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical Engineering. His research interests include computer vision, artificial intelligence, agriculture, and the Internet of Things. Ash J. S. Shi is dedicated to developing a smart farming system that seamlessly integrates AI technologies with modern agricultural practices. The systemâ€™s core objective is to determine optimal planting strategies through controlled, variable experiments. IoT sensors will continuously monitor environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity (EC), while cameras will capture crop images and store them on a cloud server. Advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including DETR and Effi-Att-UNet3+, will analyze these images to generate explainable metrics such as bud count, leaf morphology, and disease detection. Leveraging the decision-making power of reinforcement learning, the system will refine the optimal planting formulation, ultimately maximizing yield while minimizing costs.
