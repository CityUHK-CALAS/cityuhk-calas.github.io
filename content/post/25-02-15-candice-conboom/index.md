Thrilled to announce **Candice** and team's paper *"ConBOOM: A Configurable CPU Microarchitecture for Speculative Covert Channel Mitigation"* has been accepted by **Electronics**! With 5 reviewers' rigorous feedback (4 requiring detailed revisions), the team mastered constructive rebuttals under Prof. Ray's guidance and CALAS's support. Kudos to **Prof. Yao, Henry, Sanka, and Prof. Patrick**!

Good work, Candice. Keep shining!
