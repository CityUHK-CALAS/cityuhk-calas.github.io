Our paper  “Fast and Generic Inversion Architectures over GF(2m) Using Modified Itoh-Tsujii Algorithms”  has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II. We have proposed in this paper two novel architectures for multiplicative inverse over GF(2^m), which enhance  both  speed and  area-time product  of  the circuits compared with the state-of-arts.
