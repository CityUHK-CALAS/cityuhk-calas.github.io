Our CALAS New Year gathering was successfully held on January 22nd at the elegant Hilltop in The Valley, Hong Kong Jockey Club. Starting at 6 PM, this annual tradition brought our members together for an evening of celebration, networking, and fun activities.

We enjoyed a sumptuous dinner featuring highlights like juicy Wagyu beef, paired with delicious snacks. The event provided ample opportunities to connect with colleagues and VIP guests. Entertainment options, including billiards, darts, and a reserved bowling alley, made the evening lively and engaging.

The traditional gift exchange, led by lottery, added a festive touch, with generous red envelopes shared by Prof. Patrick. Special thanks to Prof. Ray and Prof. Patrick for their excellent organization and warm hospitality, creating a fruitful and memorable experience.

Thank you, everyone, for making this a fantastic start to the new year!
