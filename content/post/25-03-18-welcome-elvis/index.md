We are delighted to welcome Mr. Haochen CAI (Elvis) to our CALAS team. Elvis received his B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. He then proceeded to earn his M.Sc. in Electronic Information Engineering at City University of Hong Kong, where he is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical Engineering. With his strong background and ongoing research, we believe Elvis will be a valuable addition to the group. Letâ€™s all congratulate and support him as he begins his exciting journey with CALAS!
