        Security-aware systems require sophisticated System-on-Chip (SoC) technology involving high performance embedded microprocessors and reconfigurable hardware such as Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed CALAS studies and invents new approaches to design and to implement security-aware systems with the consideration of time-area, performance-security, and energy-cost tradeoffs. The proposed research includes security-aware hardware such as microprocessors with security-related custom-instructions, robust datapath designs, multi-core security, and secure embedded systems.
