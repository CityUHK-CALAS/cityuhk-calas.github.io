## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Logic synthesis plays a pivotal role in the circuit design process. This talk investigates advanced paradigms in logic synthesis to transcend traditional heuristic limitations. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates algebraic rewriting via equality saturation and learning-guided optimization to navigate complex Boolean spaces. Furthermore, we pioneer LLM-driven algorithmic evolution and technology-aware library extension, shifting from manual tuning to automated operator design. These methodologies collectively address fundamental challenges in optimization convergence and mapping efficiency. Extending these principles to post-Moore computing, we address the rigorous design challenges of superconducting logic (RSFQ/AQFP). Governed by flux-quantization dynamics, these technologies necessitate strict path balancing and topological constraints. We present a specialized EDA framework that adapts logic synthesis and physical design algorithms to these unique requirements. This work bridges abstract logic optimization with the realization of next-generation low-power computing systems.
