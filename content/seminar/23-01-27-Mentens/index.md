## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
While traditional chips in bulk silicon technology are widely used for reliable and highly efficient systems, there are applications that call for devices in other technologies. On the one hand, novel device technologies need to be re-evaluated with respect to potential threats and attacks and how these can be faced with existing and novel security solutions and methods. On the other hand, emerging device technologies bring opportunities for building future security systems. This talk will give an overview of the minimal hardware resources that are needed to build secure systems and discusses the state-of-the-art in design of these hardware resources in emerging device technologies.
