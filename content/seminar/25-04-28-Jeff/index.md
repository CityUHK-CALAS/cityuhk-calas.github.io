## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical domains such as defense, biomedical systems, secure communications, and autonomous vehicles. In these settings, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of FPGA- based systems is essentialâ€”from the hardware compilation process to deployment in the field. This talk presents a series of research projects addressing key challenges in FPGA security: (1) securing the FPGA compilation and CAD flow against tampering and leakage, (2) protecting intellectual property at the bitstream level, (3) evaluating and mitigating attacks on device authentication mechanisms such as PUFs, and (4) investigating reverse engineering techniques to understand and defend against IP extraction. A common thread across these efforts is the importance of understanding how high-level designs map to bitstream-level implementations, in order to support more effective security and analysis.
