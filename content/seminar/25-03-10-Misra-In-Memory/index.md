## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Data conversion, storing in volatile memories, transmission, and computation impose high energy consumption, latency, and a memory bottleneck. To achieve energy efficiency, new low-power nanoscale devices are required for the integration of sensing and in-memory computation to efficiently enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) on resource-limited systems. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) devices are currently being investigated for possible implementation of artificial intelligence hardware through in-memory computing. The electrical performance in these devices depends on the geometry and process conditions, selection of deposition parameters, pre-deposition surface treatments, and subsequent thermal budget. The talk will discuss the ReRAM devices with hydrogen plasma treated HfOâ‚‚ that have shown low-power switching and good conductance quantization with programming pulsed operation that qualify them to be used for in-memory computing. Engineering the distribution of oxygen vacancies near the top and bottom electrodes has a significant impact on reducing the switching power and improving the multi-level cell (MLC) characteristics of the device.
