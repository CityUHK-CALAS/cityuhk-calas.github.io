## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Quantum computers are emerging from theoretical possibilities into engineered, reliable systems. While we still have a long way to go, the progress in the last few years has been astounding. We now have systems that can perform meaningful computations with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits). In this talk, I will first introduce the basics of quantum information processing, and then will describe techniques that will enable quantum computations to scale into realms of useful applications.
