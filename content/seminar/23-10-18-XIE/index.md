## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has recently drawn significant attention from various communities, along with the rapid advancement in building large-scale quantum computers. Apart from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process targeting general-purpose algorithms, the research community is also looking for lightweight PQC for specific applications. In this talk, I will follow this trend to introduce the design and implementation of a promising lightweight PQC, the Ring-Binary-Learning-with-Errors (RBLWE)-based encryption scheme. Specifically, this talk stands from the hardware implementation perspective, covering algorithmic derivation and architectural innovation. A series of novel algorithms and architectures will be covered in this talk. I hope that this talk will attract more research on the lightweight PQC development and further possible standardization.
