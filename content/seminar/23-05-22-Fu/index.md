## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Defined as the fastest computers in the world by the name, supercomputers have been important tools for making scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs. In this talk, we will introduce a series of Sunway Supercomputers, which demonstrate a  superb example of integrating tens of millions of cores into a specific scientific or engineering problem and bringing chances for widening our knowledge boundary. We would also provide examples on solving extreme-scale problems on Sunwaysupercomputers, in the domain of climate modeling, earthquake simulation, quantum simulation, understanding of satellite images. Through these examples, we discuss the key issues and important efforts required for bridging the computing power and the major challenges that we face.
