## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
In this talk, I share my personal views on why post-quantum cryptography is important, then what post-quantum cryptography is, and finally, how we may conduct post-quantum cryptographic research. I will also share my study journey in Mainland, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

## Biography
<div style="text-align: justify">
Jingwei Hu received his Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong in 2018. He is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He made contributions to several post-quantum cryptographic hardware designs, one side-channel analysis methodology for post-quantum cryptographic hardware, and one post-quantum algorithmic design. In 2022, the national institute of standards and technology released a status report on the Third Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process and stated that his work confirmed the performance of BIKE would be suitable for most applications. In 2021, he was nominated by Nanyang Technological University to participate in the 9th Global Young Scientists Summit organized by National Research Foundation, Singapore. He won the Outstanding Academic Performance Award from the City University of Hong Kong in 2017.
