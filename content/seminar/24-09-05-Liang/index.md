## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
The DC-ROMA RISC-V Laptop II is the world’s first RISC-V laptop pre-installed and powered by Ubuntu, Adding to a long list of firsts, the new DC-ROMA laptop II is the first to feature SpacemiT’s SoC K1 – with its 8-cores RISC-V CPU running at up to 2.0GHz with 16GB of memory. This significantly doubled its overall performance and energy efficiency over the previous generation’s 4-cores SoC running at 1.5GHz. Sporting a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC, this groundbreaking Mainboard was independently designed and developed by DeepComputing. It’s the main component of the very first RISC-V laptop to run Canonical’s Ubuntu Desktop and Server, and the Fedora Desktop OS and represents the first independently developed Mainboard for a Framework Laptop.In conclusion, the series of product announcements by DeepComputing represents a leap forward in the realm of RISC-V technology, showcasing the convergence of innovation, collaboration, and vision. From the Modular laptop’s versatility to the Enterprise Router’s security features, each product announcement offers a glimpse into the future of RISC-V computing. As these innovations continue to evolve and reshape the technological landscape, one thing remains clear: the journey towards a more connected, secure, and efficient future has only just begun. With each unveiling, DeepComputing reaffirms its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, inspiring others to join in the pursuit of RISC-V innovation and progress.
