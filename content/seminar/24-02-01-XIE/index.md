## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
As the integrated circuit (IC) complexity keeps increasing, the chip design cost is skyrocketing. There is a compelling need for design efficiency improvement through new electronic design automation (EDA) techniques. In this talk, I will present multiple design automation techniques based on machine learning (ML) methods, whose major strength is to explore highly complex correlations based on prior circuit data. These techniques cover various chip-design objectives and design stages, including layout, netlist, register-transfer level (RTL), and micro-architectural level. I will focus on the different challenges in design objective prediction at different stages, and present our customized solutions. In addition, I will share our latest observations in design generation with large language models.
