## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Chips are ubiquitous, and AI seems omnipotent. Where are these chips? Where is this AI? Which is more powerful? This talk will share the recent chip technology progress, such as the advanced CPU, GPU, AI chip, the most powerful data centres, and the possible technology roadmap. More importantly, from the present challenges and dilemmas of various chip kinds, it will demonstrate the photonic chip's great potential and advantages.
