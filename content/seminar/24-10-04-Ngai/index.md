## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Edge Computing is the concept of capturing, storing, processing, and analyzing data closer to the location. Edge Intelligence is a combination of AI and edge computing, which enables the deployment of machine learning algorithms to the edge device where the data is generated. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction on federated learning and its benefits, major challenges, applications. Then, I will focus on system heterogeneity and robustness in federated learning. System heterogeneity aims to support edge devices with heterogeneous computation capabilities to collaborate in federated learning. It facilitates heterogeneous devices to perform federated learning with different local model architectures. After that, I will present our work on robust federated learning, which can improve the resilience of federated learning against data poisoning, model poisoning, and other kinds of security attacks.
