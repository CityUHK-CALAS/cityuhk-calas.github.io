## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
The rapid advancement of AI demands highly efficient system-on-chip (SoC) solutions to meet the computational and energy constraints of modern applications. This talk will introduce a few architecture and circuit-level innovations that enable the design of high-performance, energy-efficient AI SoCs, especially for large language models (LLMs). At architecture-level, cutting-edge accelerators will be introduced for generative Diffusion and multimodal LLMs leveraging efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) or processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques. At circuit-level, we explore novel circuit design approaches, including fine-grained SoC power management solutions for edge SoC and AI processor. By combining architectural enhancements with circuit-level optimizations, designers can achieve significant improvements in performance-per-watt, making AI acceleration feasible for edge devices, data centers, and beyond.
