## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
The globalization of supply chains, driven by the pursuit of cost reductions and competitive advantages, has reshaped the hardware industry into a multinational, distributed enterprise. While this transformation has unlocked significant efficiencies, it has also exposed critical vulnerabilities. The hardware supply chain now faces escalating challenges such as intellectual property (IP) piracy, counterfeiting, and the proliferation of hardware Trojan (i.e. malicious modifications that can severely compromise systems). The consequences of these threats are far-reaching. Financially, counterfeiting alone drains billions of dollars from the global economy annually. Operationally, compromised hardware presents grave security risks, particularly when deployed in critical infrastructure and military applications, where breaches can have catastrophic consequences. This presentation will explore these pressing issues, examining the security challenges that affect modern electronic systems. It will highlight emerging mitigation strategies, with a particular focus on machine learning (ML) technologies. Additionally, the talk will explore recent initiatives and regulatory advancements designed to combat these vulnerabilities and fortify the security of the global hardware supply chain.
