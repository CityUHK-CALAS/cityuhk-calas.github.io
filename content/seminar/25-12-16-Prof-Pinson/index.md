## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
Liberalised electricity markets, though recent in China, have existed since the early 1990s in countries like the UK. Their evolution has been shaped by renewable energy integration, decentralisation, digitisation, and advances in computing such as AI. There is growing consensus that electricity markets must be rethought, with changes likely to be fundamental rather than incremental. This talk argues it is timely to consider AI at the core of market design, replacing traditional optimisation and solvers. It explores global AI-based approaches to optimal power flow, linear programming, and unit commitment, concluding with a roadmap for AI-driven future electricity markets.
