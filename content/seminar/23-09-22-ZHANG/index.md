## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
As modern AI is reshaping almost every aspect of our daily life, responsible AI has become an increasingly important topic: we should design and deploy AI with good intentions and positive impacts, both technically and socially. In the first part of the talk, we will focus on the trustworthiness issue of AI inference. Specifically, we will present a self-healing method, which can detect and fix the possible errors of a neural network automatically in the inference. This method is formulated as a closed-loop control. Since this method does not need a-priori attack information, it can handle a broad class
of unforeseen attacks or perturbations that conventional methods cannot handle. The second part of the talk will focus on the sustainability issue of
large-scale AI training. Record-breaking GPU-hours have been used to train large deep learning models, causing ever increasing carbon emissions.

The huge model size also prevents energy-efficient on-device training. We will show our efforts in tensor-compressed training. This method can reduce the training variables of large models by several orders of magnitudes, enabling energy-efficient training on both cloud and resource-constraint platforms.
