## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
This talk presents advances in hardware acceleration of demanding workloads, especially those involving machine learning. It begins with an overview of recent progress in hardware acceleration, covering applications and tools. An approach is then described for speeding up constraint-based causal discovery by shifting performance bottlenecks. Finally, some thoughts about future directions of design automation for hardware acceleration will be provided.
