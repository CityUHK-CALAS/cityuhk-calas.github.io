## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
(Fully) Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising privacy-enhancing cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption, and it has potentially wide applications across various industries. However, the primary challenge faced by HE is its low performance. The GPU, a powerful accelerator not only for Al tasks but also for cryptographic computations, is explored to accelerate HE in this context. This presentation first provides a brief overview of HE and its applications, then delves into the implementation details of HE. We explore several optimizations for both low-level arithmetic and high-level homomorphic operations on GPUs. Building on these foundations, we introduce an open-sourced GPU library specifically for word-wise HE schemes, named Phantom FHE. Finally, some potential directions for future research are discussed.
