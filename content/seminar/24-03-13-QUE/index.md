## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
In the domain of scientific research, particularly in fields like particle physics, the demand for rapid data acquisition and in- situ processing systems is critical. These systems rely on custom processing elements with very low latency and high data bandwidth, along with real-time control modules. Integrating real-time machine learning algorithms with these processes can enable advances in scientific discovery. A critical component of such integrations is the acceleration of deep learning inference using reconfigurable accelerators such as FPGAs, which enables sophisticated processing in real-time with superior accuracy. In this talk, I first describe the FPGA-based fast Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tailored for particle physics applications, demonstrating our achievements in minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. I then present our new studies on automation of optimizations for Fast Deep Learning (FastDL) in scientific applications.
