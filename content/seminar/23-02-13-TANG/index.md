## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
In this talk, I am going to look back at my career development in academia for the past 15 years. I will first share my experiences in various roles of an instructor, a lecturer, a center director, and an engineer, that I had been through in CUHK and QMUL. In particular, I would like to contrast the difference in the teaching environments between China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, I will also highlight my thoughts on building the skill sets that enable effective lecture delivery and programme development. Lastly, I would like to discuss recent changes in higher education and invite the audience to a dialogue about the education of our future.
